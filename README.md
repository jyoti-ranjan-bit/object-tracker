# object-tracker
This repository contains the source code and documentation for an object tracking robot built using a Raspberry Pi. The system uses computer vision techniques and machine learning to detect, identify, and track objects in real-time, allowing the robot to autonomously follow a target object.

**Features**
Real-time object detection and tracking, 
Autonomous movement control based on target object position, 
Support for multiple object classes, 
Easy-to-use interface for selecting tracking targets, 
Configurable tracking parameters, 

**Hardware Requirements**
Raspberry Pi 02W, 
Pi Camera Module or USB Webcam, 
Robot chassis with motors (should be big enough to support a power bank, 
Motor controller board (e.g., L298N), 
Power bank or battery pack, 
(Optional) Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance

**Software Dependencies**
Python 3.7+, 
OpenCV, 
TensorFlow Lite, 
NumPy, 
RPi.GPIO,
